# The Psychophysical Entity {#psychophysical}

Unlike robotic hosts, primitive jelly based entities and rocks, the human host is not straightforward to control. In addition to the autonomous processes described in the [previous chapter](#control), there's also many feedback loops between the host and the control hardware that can cause further confusion.


Some of the feedback loops are more obvious, such as the failsafes preventing you from pushing the host beyond it's current physical limits. Short term failsafes stop you from ripping the limb and body actuators off the support structures when exerting force and preventing the circulatory system pump from exploding. These failsafes are automatically overridden in case of an emergency but can cause permanent damage or premature expiration of the host.

The long term feedback systems are of more interest to a resident as they are much more readily accessible and actionable. 
* Soreness of actuators after exerting high force
* Unspecific elation after strenuous activity
* ???


As described in the chapter about [evolution](#evolution), a human host adapts extremely well to any kind of non-leathal environments and conditions, but it is not neccessarily an optimal adaptation.
