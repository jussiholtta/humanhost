# Evolution {#evolution}
To understand how the human body works, it's important to understand it's evolutionary history. Around 2 million years ago human ancestors first started walking upright, moved from the jungle to the savannah and started hunting other animals instead of just scavening and gathering food. Humans have never based their hunting on typical characteristics that you see in modern predators such as deadly fangs and teeth or explosive speed to quickly catch their prey. Some predators do hunt in packs and cooperation is an important for humans too, but we'll speak more about that in chapter X. The thing that makes human hunters special is their stamina. A human can catch an antilope by running after it until it drops from exhaustion. 
It was during this period up to about 200000 years ago when the anatomy of modern humans was formed. It may not be obvious observing modern day humans, but they share the same biology with those early hunters. Humans have been running and walking long distances for hundreds of thousands of years before starting to settle. This history explains many of the quirks of the human body and why it seems so difficult to maintain a host in the modern day world.
